# Virtual-Desktop-System-
## Final Year Project 
    The project aim is to secure the network or a LAN by implementing such a software
which is enable to carry out operations which are capable to monitor whole of the network,
sitting on one chair by viewing remote desktop, passing messages to remote system and is also
able to shut down the system by performing remote aborting operations. This software is purely
developed in Java. This project is to provide the maximum details about the network to the
administrator on their screen without knowing them their users.
    In the previous system they can store the Activity of the one system and monitor on one
machine so the proposed of previous system we can develop a Virtual Desktop system. The
processes that are running in a particular system can be viewed only in that system itself by using
the present generation softwareâ€™s. But using Virtual Desktop System, we can display the
processes running on any other computer systems on our own system. Also, we can capture the
static image of any remote system.
    A System Administrator is a person who manages a computer network. The System
Administrator deals with various operations while monitoring the network. Virtual Desktop
System helps the System Administrator to monitoring the network and the clients in it. Using the
Virtual Desktop System software, the administrator can view the operations of the remote system
from his system itself. The administrator can get the configuration of the remote system from the
server system itself using this software.
This project has been made keeping in mind the tasks and duties of a system
administrator. The Virtual Desktop System is a fast, easy and efficient way for Administrator
check and Monitor the clients Machine.
